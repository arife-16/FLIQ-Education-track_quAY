# FLIQ-Education-track_quAY
# Grover's Algorithm: A Quantum Search Tutorial with Qiskit

## Project Overview

This project provides an educational Jupyter Notebook (`FLIQ_Education_track_Implementing_quantum_algorithms.ipynb`) that explains and implements Grover's quantum search algorithm using Qiskit. The tutorial is designed for individuals new to quantum computing or those looking to understand the mechanics of Grover's algorithm, from its conceptual strategy to practical implementation on simulators and (placeholder for) real quantum hardware.

The core goal is to simplify quantum search by breaking down the algorithm into understandable components: superposition, the oracle (marking the target), and the diffuser (amplitude amplification).

## Key Learning Objectives

By working through this tutorial, users should be able to:
*   Understand the problem Grover's Algorithm addresses (searching an unsorted database).
*   Grasp the mathematical concepts and linear algebra operations behind quantum superposition, phase manipulation by the oracle, and amplitude amplification via the diffuser.
*   Construct the Grover's algorithm circuit block by block in Qiskit.
*   Simulate the algorithm and interpret the results, observing the probabilistic advantage.
*   (Understand the steps for running the algorithm on IBM Quantum hardware).

## Repository Contents

*   **`FLIQ_Education_track_Implementing_quantum_algorithms.ipynb`**: The main educational Jupyter Notebook containing explanations, Qiskit code, and visualizations.
*   **`Grovers Algorithm.py`**: A Python script for local testing of the Grover's algorithm implementation. This script allows for quick verification of the algorithm's correctness for small instances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   Qiskit (`pip install qiskit qiskit-aer`)
*   Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
*   (Optional, for running on IBM Quantum hardware: `qiskit-ibm-provider` and an IBM Quantum API token)

### Running the Tutorial Notebook

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```
4.  Open the `FLIQ_Education_track_Implementing_quantum_algorithms.ipynb` file.
5.  Follow the instructions and run the code cells sequentially.

### Using the Local Testing Script

The `Grovers Algorithm.py` script can be run from your terminal to verify the core algorithm functions:

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python "Grovers Algorithm.py"
    ```
    The script will run predefined test cases and report whether they PASSED or FAILED based on the probability of finding the marked item.

## Algorithm Example

The main example used in the tutorial and testing script is a search for a specific item among $N=8$ items (requiring 3 data qubits + 1 ancilla qubit). The optimal number of Grover iterations for this case (finding 1 marked item) is approximately 2.

## Next Steps & Further Exploration

*   Complete the "Example Running on Real Quantum Hardware" section in the notebook with actual job submission code.
*   Explore Grover's algorithm for multiple marked items.
*   Investigate the impact of noise when running on real quantum devices.
